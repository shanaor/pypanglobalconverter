# Pandas Global Converter
This package comes to unit all types that Pandas package can convert into one package.
It Maybe already in existence or even better package to include all types Globaly exist But if not, I hope it would help someone.

## what does it take from you to use it 
A file to convert and its copied path adress from the folder he resides in 
and love of pandas (Dad jokes in readme files...)

### gives an exit option in every section of the program for user comfortability

<br>

## I didnt try all the options to see it run smoothly but i tested this much (feel free to add if you tested a new conversion):
- converted_converted_data.csv
- converted_data.feather
- converted_data.h5
- converted_data.hdf
- converted_data.html
- converted_data.json
- converted_data.xlsx
- converted_data.xml
- converted_data to Clipboard
- converted_data.sqlite3
- converted_data.sqlite
- converted_data.spss

Remark!!!------------------------------------------>>>>>>>  Some files i know converted succesfuly because Visual Studio Code recognized and presented while some seems to be binary or not supported to be read by Visual Basic Code so there was no special symbol next to them.

## Files it converts from, and to 
--------
- csv
--------
- json
--------
- xml
--------
- xlsx
--------
- xls
--------
- hdf

# requirments
-------------
this is before i learned virtual enviroment so couldnt do pip freeze requirments on time so this is part list: 
import pandas as pd
import os
import sys
import sqlite3
pip pyreadstat

Hope i could finish this properly and make changes to make the program alert when specific libraries are needed.
